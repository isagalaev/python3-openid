This is a project for refactoring JanRain's [python-openid][] library into a
sane, maintainable OpenID (version 1 and 2) consumer library for Python3. It is
technically  a fork of the [python3-openid][] which is an independent port of
the original library to Python3. sm-openid, however is going to be a pretty much
full rewrite with a new structure and new APIs.

The library is usable in its current state but it is a work in progress and it
will break your code if you decide to depend on it and update without paying
attention!

Instead, join me in this refactoring. Refactoring is fun!
